"""
You have an array of integers, and for each index you want to find the product of every integer except the integer at that index.
Write a function get_products_of_all_ints_except_at_index() that takes an array of integers and returns an array of the products.

For example, given:

[1, 7, 3, 4]

your function would return:

[84, 12, 28, 21]

by calculating:

[7*3*4, 1*3*4, 1*7*4, 1*7*3]

Do not use division in your solution.
